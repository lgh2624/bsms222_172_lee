# 3 R Basics

## 3.2 The very basics

### 3.2.1 Objects

We can store some stuffs in R. We call it 'object' and we can use them similiar to how we do in math.
For example, we can simplify equations as a form like ax^2+bx+c=0. If we are given a equation x^2+x-1=0, then we define with the sign "<-" like:

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 1
c <- -1
```

And we can check the value stored in 'a' by typing:

```{r}
a
```

Or, we can print it by typing:

```{r}
print(a)
```

### 3.2.2. The workspace

We can change our 'workspace' by defining objects and see all the variables saved in by typing:

```{r}
ls()
```
